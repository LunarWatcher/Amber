These are changes made prior to the use of proper versioning (largely because tracking stuff up to a tag doesn't make sense)

## 29.03.2021

* Introduced `g:AmberCurrentTheme` to allow for resavability
* Made group insertion skip groups already present in Amber.
* Added comments that're also passed on to the resulting VimScript
